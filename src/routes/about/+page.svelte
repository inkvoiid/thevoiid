			<h2>My name is Kaleb Dickson and I am a developer.</h2>
			<p>
				I'm 21 years old and a recent graduate of Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, studying a
				Bachelor of Applied Information Technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love building systems to organise information that look good while doing it. I'm
				experienced in C#, UWP, React, Angular and Unity development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of my most proud work I've done would be my{' '}
				<a href="./projects/our-kitchen">recipe web app</a>, my
				<a href="./projects/star-wars-movie-site">Star Wars movie site</a>, which just looks nice,
				and my UWP app in the style of a
				<a href="./projects/moebile">phone app for Moe's Bar</a>.
