        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/inkvoiid/ChessGame">And My Rook!</a> is a Chess-like game I created in 2022 for my project in my 2nd year of my Applied I.T. degree.
          It combines the rules of Chess with a leveling up system, health bars, upgrades and more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The pieces start off made out of glass, which means shatter in one hit, but they can be upgraded to be made out of wood, stone, iron and diamond. Each upgrade increases the health of the piece by 1, meaning a diamond piece has 5 health.
